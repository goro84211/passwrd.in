# passwrd

Private, Secure & Simple password generator.




## Why ?

- A lot of existing website either advertise themselves or they make it a complex process.
- Few of them collect password for "analytics" purposes.
- Sometimes you need a strong password, sometimes you need easy to remember.
- There is password generation feature in chrome - sometimes it doesn't work.
- You are a sys admin, org admin or a developer and you need to give good password to business user - rather test, 1234 .... you know it !
- You just need a website which can give you a password without any bullshit.
- You want to self host fancy password generator.
